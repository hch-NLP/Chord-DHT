# Chord-DHT

Using Chord DHT to build the  file shared system with Java

* This is a file sharing system that simulates distributed hash tables in a local multi-node peer-to-peer network through multiple threads, written in Java language.

* The program run file is:
   * Main.java
   * Using JDK 1.8+ to run it.
   # URL: https://github.com/hch-NLP/Chord-DHT
   * It is a program with its own visual action page.

* Thanks to Martin777777's open source project

# Todo:
* In the future, consider making it a truly distributed file sharing system, allowing it to support cross-machine, cross-network and cross-domain sharing.
