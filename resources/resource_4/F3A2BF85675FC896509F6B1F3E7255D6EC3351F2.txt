abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) platforms are evolving to support immersive 3D experiences.
Most modern AR platforms support only a single immersive app at a time, but users
may also benefit from the ability to engage with multiple apps at once. The ability
of different apps to simultaneously augment a user's world raises critical questions:
how might apps visually conflict with each other, and how can we design AR platforms
to support rich behaviors while mediating conflicts? In this work, we pose and explore
these questions, identifying means of visual conflict as well as platform design strategies
to mediate conflicts. We then analyze state-of-the-art AR platforms (HoloLens, Magic
Leap One, and Meta 2) to understand their trade-offs and identify unexplored gaps
in the broader design space. Our exploration reveals key guidelines and lessons to
inform future multi-app AR efforts.},

abstract = {Background: We have developed and set up the SkinExplorer™ platform, a new tool to
exploit and rebuild serial confocal images into 3D numerical models [1, 2]. The acquisitions
using confocal microscopy allow visualizing cutaneous components as elastic fibers,
melanocytes and keratinocytes etc... These diversified sources of data participate
to create numerical 3D volume models with high quality of visualization.Objective:
To create a Virtual Reality (VR) experience, to communicate and change the perception
of skin structures by virtualization mode.Methods: The use of ART TRACKPACK system
and ART SMARTTRACK device allow us to valorize new sensory images for the volumetric
rendering of the 3D skin models.Results: We increase the perception and the understanding
of skin components organization.Conclusion: The SkinExplorer™ platform seems to be
a promising system for exploring the skin.},

abstract = {The act of teaching has become a challenge as the content becomes more democratic
and present in the daily life of elementary and middle school students. Mathematics
has presented great difficulty for students to understand since several of its contents,
of an abstract nature, need to be presented efficiently, mainly due to the lack of
appropriate didactic resources. The present work presents three software for the teaching
of mathematics of Plato's Polyhedrons through the visualization of their characteristics:
faces, vertices, edges, planning and separation of faces, using technologies of Augmented
Reality and Virtual Reality, so that the user can manipulate and view in 3D. The goal
of software development was to provide accessible, easy-to-use tools that draw students'
attention to help math teachers in basic education.},

To provide a proper user experience, a low E2E latency and a high bandwidth are both
required. Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve in a shared network like the
Internet. My PhD project focuses on the study and analysis of modern network protocols
to identify viable solutions for a suitable user experience.},

A Haptic Feedback Device Reduces Dizziness in Users Watching a Virtual Reality Video【11】

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate methods by which to reduce the dizziness
that people experience when watching virtual reality (VR) videos. VR technology is
being used in increasing numbers of fields, but a phenomenon that causes dizziness
is common. A head-mounted display (HMD) is the device generally worn for viewing virtual
reality videos. HMDs put the screen close to the eyes, and users often feel pressure
and also experience dizziness. The feeling of dizziness is a result of the unique
constitution of each person. In this work, different subjects were selected based
on their level of physical fitness. This research showed that haptic feedback caused
by vibration during the viewing process can help reduce dizziness. We designed a vibration
device, which was mounted on the HMD headband. Through sensing audio from the video,
the vibrator is triggered, and the feeling of vibration is feed back to the haptic
device. In the study, we used four vibration points, A1, A2, O1, and O2 near the areas
of the brain affected by the detection points. The head is a highly sensitive organ
that experiences a tactile sensation due to the vibration of the headband when an
individual is watching a VR movie, thereby causing inconsistent visual and body perceptions.
We found in the current research that the dizziness felt when watching VR video is
caused by the inconsistency between visual and cognitive experiences. Typically, the
tactile sensation can reduce such cognitive sensations and lower the degree of dizziness
experienced by the wearer.},
